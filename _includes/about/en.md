Hi, this is **Leon Ling**，also **Liyang Ling**. Now I am a new graduate of **Big Data Tech** in **HKUST**. Currently, I am working on software developing and big data development. 

For my self, I think I am only a starter of Computer Science and Data Science fields, and willing to become an excellent team player, problem solver, enthusiastic learner and REAL engineer one day in the future.

For the life outside of the study and work, electronic devices and host games appeals to me most. What's more, table tennis is my favorite and I have been trained as a professional player for several years, it also brought me some glories and many friends.

This is my personal blog, through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyll.com.cn/), thanks **Hux** for his excellent theme [**HuxPro**](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io), also some small features were added by my self, if you are interested, feel free to folk [my blog repo](https://github.com/lyonling/lyonling.github.io).
