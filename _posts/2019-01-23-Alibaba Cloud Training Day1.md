*In this picture, there are many new words for me, I will collect them and give the brief explaination later.*  

>All the notes on first day I will update after clearing systematically.

### Common Concepts

Among my handwriting note, teacher gave us the comparison of Hadoop and Alibaba Cloud architecture. Below I will also separate those word by this two system.

>All explaination I will finished later

#### Hadoop

* HDFS
* YARN
* Zookeeper
* Hive
* Flume
* Sqoop
* Kafka
* Flink
* HUE



#### Alibaba Cloud

* Pangu()
* Fuxi()
* Nvwa()
* Zhongkui()
* Apsara
* MaxCompute
* Dataworks
* OSS
* PAI

* Blink

  Blink is a kind of service based on Flink.

  In today's course, the lecturer stressed on several times that Alibaba has bought `Apache Flink` and developed `Blink`, so now we only need to call it **Blink**.

  For this story, I just want to send this picture.
