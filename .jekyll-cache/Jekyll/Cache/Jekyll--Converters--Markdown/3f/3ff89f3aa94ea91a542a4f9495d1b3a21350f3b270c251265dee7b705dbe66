  <p>In social network theory, social relationships are viewed in terms of <strong><em>nodes</em></strong> and <strong><em>ties</em></strong>. Nodes are the individual actors within the networks, and ties are the relationships between the actors. There can be many kinds of ties between the nodes. In its simplest form, a social network is a map of all of the relevant <strong>ties</strong> between the nodes being studied.</p>
