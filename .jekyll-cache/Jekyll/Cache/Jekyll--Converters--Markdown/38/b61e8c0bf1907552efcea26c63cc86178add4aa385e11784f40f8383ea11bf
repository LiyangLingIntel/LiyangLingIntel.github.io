<p>Hi, this is <strong>Leon Ling</strong>，also <strong>Liyang Ling</strong>. Now I am a new graduate of <strong>Big Data Tech</strong> in <strong>HKUST</strong>. Currently, I am working on software developing and big data development.</p>

<p>For my self, I think I am only a starter of Computer Science and Data Science fields, and willing to become an excellent team player, problem solver, enthusiastic learner and REAL engineer one day in the future.</p>

<p>For the life outside of the study and work, electronic devices and host games appeals to me most. What’s more, table tennis is my favorite and I have been trained as a professional player for several years, it also brought me some glories and many friends.</p>
