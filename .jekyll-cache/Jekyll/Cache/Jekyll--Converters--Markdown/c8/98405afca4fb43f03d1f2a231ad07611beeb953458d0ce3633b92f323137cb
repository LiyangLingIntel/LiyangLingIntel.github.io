  <p>Firstly, I am very honor to take part in the Alibaba Cloud Big Data Certification Course. Although it’s only two days long, a lot of new concepts are given to me, like an iceberg waiting me to discover.</p>

  <p>In this course, basic idea of cloud computing and the way how Alibaba dealing with it are taught to us. I’m going to write down all I learnt here.</p>

  <p>Thanks Alibaba, BDT, lecturer Derek and our program director Prof Chen for providing this opportunity to us.</p>
